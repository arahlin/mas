logger - MAS logging application

The MAS logger consists of two main parts, the server and the client
library.  This folder contains the server and a simple client that
uses the client library.  The client library is called libmaslog and
should be around here somewhere.

The server must be linked to "socks.o", which contains helpful
ports-related functions.  The server must also be linked with
libconfig, which lets us load nice configuration files (more about
that later).

The logging server consists of the files (with + indicating linking
that must be done to external files):

	logger.c
	logger.h
	init.c
	init.h
	main.c
	+socks.o
	+libconfig

The client consists of

	client.c
	+libmaslog
	+libconfig

The configuration information is loaded by default from /etc/mas.cfg,
and should look something like this:

log_client:
{
	log_address = "localhost:7894";
};

log_server:
{
	log_address = "localhost:7894";
	log_file = "log";
	daemon = 1;
};
