 WHAT WILL THE DATA TASK DO?
-----------------------------

Interface to mce driver
 - open file
 - set frame size
 - initiate go
 - watch for end of sequence
 - close file
 - signal something somehow?


Plug-in options:
 - checksum verification, termination criteria
 - sequence tracking and checking
 - file cycling

Command interface is texty, over socket. e.g.
 - setrows 41
 - sethead 43
 - setrc rc1
Then it calculates frame size?  Or
 - setframesize 5424
to override.

 - setsequence 1 132
 - setfile out.dat
 - setrefile 10M
 - setfilef out_%02i.dat
 - setrefile 100000


GO can only be sent if:
 - not already busy
 - file is chosen and open
 - framesize is reasonable
 - communication with mcecmd device is open

After GO is sent, BUSY is set.

BUSY is cleared when one of:
 - STOP command is sent
 - last frame is received
 - driver error

When BUSY, all commands are rejected except
 - status queries
 - stop command
 - changefile command


LOGICAL MODE must rearrange frame data.

For each card
  transpose/widen into output buffer at offset


File handling: files.c
