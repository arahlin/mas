   * - mce://HOST/N
   *
   *   indicating the remote MCE device #N on the mcenetd daemon running on
   *   HOST.  (NB: This is not necessarily the MCE attached to card #N on
   *   HOST, but the N'th item in *this* list in the mas.cfg file on HOST.
   *
   * ALSO NOTE: "mce:/0" is *not* the same as "mce://localhost/0".  The first
   * of these communicates directly to the MCE on fibre card #0, the second
   * communicates to MCE device #0 managed by the mcenetd running on this
   * computer, that is, the first MCE device defined in whichever mas.cfg
   * file that was read by the mcenetd daemon, which is probably not the same
   * thing.
