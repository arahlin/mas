This directory contains files for wrapping the MAS C API into python
classes.

The swig interface file mce_library.i is used to expose the basic
libarary functions as a python module mce_library.  A more useful
module for applications is mce.py, which exposes MCE operations in the
mce class.

Once compiled, you can use the mce class by making sure that
mce_library.py, _mce_library.so, and mce.py are in your python path
and then doing

    import mce

in your script.

The 'test' directory contains some test / demo programs for using the
module.
